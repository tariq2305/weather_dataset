WEATHER  DATASET made with the help of python.

OVERVIEW 

This repository contains a Python-based workflow for exploring, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a weather dataset. The project demonstrates a practical data analytics pipeline using pandas for data wrangling and plotly.express for interactive visualizations. Typical use cases include summarizing temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind metrics, performing time series analysis, and generating insights for reporting or dashboards.

FEATURES

Data loading from CSV/Parquet with robust parsing of dates and numeric fields.

Cleaning steps: missing value handling, unit normalization, outlier checks, and feature engineering (e.g., daily aggregates, rolling means).

Exploratory analysis: descriptive statistics, groupby summaries by date, station, or location.

Interactive charts: line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, box plots for distribution analysis, scatter plots for relationships.

Simple, reproducible scripts and notebook(s) for end-to-end execution.

PROJECT STRUCTURE

data/: Raw and processed weather files (ignored or sampled as needed).

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and visualization.

src/: Python scripts for ingestion, cleaning, analysis, and plotting.

reports/: Exported charts and summary tables.

README.md: Project documentation and usage.

requirements.txt or pyproject.toml: Dependencies.

GETTING STARTED
 
 Prerequisites
   
   Python 3.9+
   
   Recommended: a virtual environment (venv or conda)

INSTALLATION
 
 Clone the repository.
 
 Create and activate a virtual environment.
 
 Install dependencies:
 
 pip install pandas plotly

DATA
 
 The project expects a tabular weather dataset with columns such as:
 
 datetime or date (ISO format recommended)
 
 temperature metrics (e.g., temp, temp_min, temp_max in Â°C)
 
 humidity (%), wind_speed (m/s or km/h), precipitation (mm), pressure (hPa)
